    <p><em>Contemporary Art is generally classified as artworks made during or after 1945, so from just after the Second World War right up to modern day. Within this period there is a huge range in styles, genres, and approaches, and it can be hard to know where to start. Artsper has brought together 25 examples of contemporary artwork that we think are most important to know about – from the most famous pieces to the lesser known, rising talents.</em>

<h3> Andy Warhol, Campbell’s Soup Cans, 1962</h3>
<p><em>This famous piece was one of Andy Warhol’s first ventures into using images from consumer culture and mass media in his work, a trend which would later come to define his distinctive style. Although the careful repetition of the piece echoes market mass production, Warhol didn’t start employing his famous silk screen printing technique until after completing this work, so each of these identical cans is actually hand-painted. It became a symbol of contemporary artworks.
